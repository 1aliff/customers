## About
- Build API with NodeJS and Express (API folder)
- Connect API into React Web App (Client folder)

## Steps
Install both dependencies using npm

1) go into API directory and run 
> nodemon index.js

2) go into Client directory and run
> npm start

Noted that I have used proxy setting in package.json(inside client directory) to redirect my API request to Node server.

## Improvement
- I will look into impoving this by creating a script to run both concurrently
- Form Checking
- Maybe cosmetics changes

As of now, it is working (just without the form checking). Thanks!
